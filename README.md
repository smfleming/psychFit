Code for fitting psychometric functions in Matlab using maximum likelihood estimation

Collection of scripts I wrote for fitting psychometric funcitons in Matlab using maximum-likelihood techniques. Code for doing these fits is available in lots of toolboxes but I found they were often overly complex for my needs.

At the moment the implemented fits are cumulative normal, logistic and cumulative normal with a lapse rate, but the framework could be easily extended to include other functions (e.g. Weibull).

The main function is psychFit.m. psychPlot.m will produce plots of the data and fitted function. Check out example_psychFit.m to get started.
